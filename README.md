## 📦 Download and Installation

Pre-compiled versions for **Windows** and **Linux** are available in the [Releases](https://github.com/MikolajFilipkowski/beatemup/releases) section of this repository.

### How to run:
1. **Download** the latest `.zip` or `.tar.gz` archive for your operating system.
2. **Extract** the contents to a folder of your choice.
3. **Run** the executable:
   * **Windows:** Double-click `beatemup.exe`.
   * **Linux:** Execute `./beatemup_game` via terminal.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All assets (graphics, levels, fonts) are included in the archive. Please do not move the executable out of its folder, as it relies on relative paths to load game data.

## 🎨 Use of Generative AI
For this project, **Generative AI** was utilized specifically for the creation of certain visual assets:
* **User Interface (UI):** AI tools assisted in generating icons, menu elements, and HUD components.
* **Select Sprite Assets:** Some environmental textures and character sprites were generated or enhanced using AI to maintain a consistent industrial-urban aesthetic.
